.HU "APPENDIX 2 - EXAMPLE USE OF A GRAMMATICAL CHANNEL"
.P
This appendix presents an example of the use of a grammatical
channel to transport messages involved in the control of
a telephone call in a ficticious telephone switch.
Two processes are used, one to control each
end of the connection between an originating and terminating
party.  Only the originating process logic is shown.
.P
The example begins with the originator process, knowing the
address of the terminating party, obtaining a channel to use
for the message exchange.  Then it requests to connect to
the terminating party
by sending a message through a common channel to a routing
process (not shown), which creates the terminating process
and passes to it the channel identity that it will use
to communicate with the originator.  The two processes then
carry out the rest of the call.  In this system, the called
party is able to signal the originating end to hold the
connection up, i.e. prevent the originating party from
disconnecting the call.
